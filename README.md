## A. Visualization of neurons via input optimization 
The code is in Ass_A.py, which is changed by the original code named 'myalexnet_forward_newtf.py'. And there are some outputs generated by this experiment with diﬀerent learning accuracy and gradient update function, all of them are in the ﬁle named 'A_gen'.

## B. Natural image statistics 
The code is in Ass_B.py, and I use the 122th class(king crab, Alaska crab, Alaskan king crab, Alaska king crab, Paralithodes camtschatica) for this section. Due to time constraints, I only ran 1200 steps. So it can not do well enough(I am sorry).

## C. Fooling a network 
The code is in Ass_C.py, and the example output ﬁles are 'C_poodle', 'C_laska'. In each ﬁle, every image named by 'number_class-names_probability', 'number' means the image generation order, 'class-name' means which class this image be identiﬁed, 'probability' means the probability that the picture is recognized as this class.

## D. Classiﬁcation importance map 
The code is in 'Ass_D.py', and the output importance maps are in ﬁles named 'D_dog', 'D_poodle', which shows importance maps in each iteration.
